# Justification and Reflection

## Tech Stack:

1. **Node.js with Express.js**: Node.js was chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it suitable for handling asynchronous operations like HTTP requests. Express.js, a minimalist web framework, offers simplicity, flexibility, and a robust middleware ecosystem for creating RESTful APIs and routing.

2. **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL was selected as the relational database management system (RDBMS) due to its reliability, ACID compliance, and extensive feature set. It provides support for complex queries, data integrity constraints, and scalability, making it ideal for handling structured data and relational queries.

3. **Multer**: Multer middleware was chosen for handling multipart/form-data, enabling seamless processing of file uploads in the Express.js application. Multer simplifies file upload handling by providing an easy-to-use API for storing uploaded files and accessing file metadata.

## Database:

1. **PostgreSQL Database**: PostgreSQL was chosen for several reasons:
   - **Reliability**: Known for its stability, data integrity, and robustness.
   - **Performance**: Offers excellent performance optimizations such as indexing and query optimization.
   - **Scalability**: Supports replication, partitioning, and clustering for scaling database infrastructure.
   - **Rich Feature Set**: Provides support for advanced SQL features, data types, and extensions.


## Challenges Addressed:

1. **File Upload Handling**: Integrated Multer middleware for handling file uploads, simplifying the process of receiving, storing, and processing uploaded files.

2. **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms, including centralized error middleware and custom error classes, to gracefully handle and respond to various types of errors encountered during request processing.

3. **Data Modeling and Schema Design**: Carefully designed database schema and data models to reflect underlying domain concepts and application requirements. Adhered to best practices in data modeling, normalization, and indexing to ensure data integrity, consistency, and efficiency in database operations.

In conclusion, the choice of Node.js with Express.js, PostgreSQL, and associated technologies was driven by considerations of performance, scalability, reliability, and ease of development. These technologies provide a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich web applications, effectively addressing the challenges of the project.
